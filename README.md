### Kevin - @kevinlangmade

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a self-taught (ha!) software engineer looking grow my skills. The idea of being self-taught is an absolute joke, as I could have never done this without the incredible resources the the open-source community has made available. I would love to be more than a consumer, but a producer of that content. 


My goal will always be to create with clarity. As I develop my programming skillset, that principal will be my bowling alley inflatable bumpers. Simplicity is clarity's best friend but not everything can be simple at the macro scale. I hope to help bring simplicity and clarity to the world a little bit at a time by taking bite-sized problems and work my way up. 


I welcome any feedback (on practice or philosophy) or recommendations for how I can continue to make all of this possible!
